# # Find-S Algorithm:
# ## Algorithm:
# 1. Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H
# 2. For each positive training instance x
#         i. For each attribute constraint a i in h :
#             a. If the constraint a i in h is satisfied by x Then do nothing
#             b. Else replace a i in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x
# 3. Output hypothesis h

# Load the csv file and asign each row to a data frame
# Also print the row to see the dataset (optional)

# Implementation of the above algorithm by updaing the hypothesis at each iteration and output the final hypothesis.
